## The Jucy (stet) Lucy Issue

If you were to ask most people to name the food item most distinctive to the
Twin Cities — our cheesesteak or New York slice — the answer you'll probably
hear the most is the "jucy lucy."

What is a jucy lucy? It's basically an inverted cheeseburger — instead of cheese
melted on top of the patty, the cheese is **inside** the patty. There's a
creation myth that [follows a familiar pattern](http://southtwelfth.tumblr.com/post/98729598583/the-ur-myth-of-regional-midwestern-burgers).

There’s some controversy about this, but this guide’s position is that the
lucy was invented at Matt’s Bar — so if getting the original is important to
you, go there. There's often a line.
